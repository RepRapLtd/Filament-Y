# Filament-Y
A design for a 3D printer filament merging Y for multiple-material RepRaps

[How it goes together](Pix/construction.jpg)

This design is based on a wonderfully simple idea from Martin Zeman (see: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3039887).  It is easy to print, to construct and to put together.  In operation it works very smoothly with low friction.

Two input 4mm PTFE Bowden feeds come straight through the pneumatic fittings [] on the right of the picture.
